## Abstract

Eden is a **garden‑first economic and intelligence system** that inverts traditional blockchain architecture. Gardens (federated, intelligent nodes) are primary; blockchain is subordinate. Eden replaces gas fees and smart‑contract rigidity with **LLM‑governed intelligence fees**, **federated gardens**, and a **ROOT Certificate Authority (ROOT CA)** that certifies trust, services, and replication. Eden is **gas‑free**, **garden‑driven**, **LLM‑native**, **service‑oriented**, and **self‑policing, self‑governing, and self‑replicating**.

## Core Philosophy

> **"In Eden, no action is valid unless it is understandable, attributable, and reversible by intelligence."**

Actions must be: **understandable** (LLM can reason), **attributable** (tied to certified identity), and **reversible by intelligence** (undoable through ledger replay). **Most systems decentralize machines. Eden decentralizes judgment.**

---

## System Actors

**ROOT CA**: Global certification authority managing ServiceRegistry, providing LLM Service Mapper, operating Price Order Service, and serving as sole settlement authority.

**Gardens**: Federated Docker nodes running identical LLM versions, querying ServiceRegistry, providing intelligence/routing/pricing, executing transactions but never settling them.

**Users**: Free actors (not wallet addresses) interacting through natural language with certified identities.

---

## Universal Messaging System

Eden's messaging is a **first-class system primitive** with governed conversations scoped to contexts (ORDER, TRADE, SERVICE, DISPUTE, SYSTEM, GOVERNANCE). Messages are immutable events (TEXT, MEDIA, ACTION, SYSTEM) with states (ACTIVE, FORGIVEN, REDACTED)—never deleted, only state changes.

### Dual-Mode Chat

**Eden Chat** (Workflow Queries): Action-oriented queries triggering workflows ("Trade 2 SOL with TOKEN", "Buy movie tickets"). Flow: Query → LLM extraction → ServiceRegistry → Workflow → Settlement.

**Regular Text Chat** (Informational Queries): Information requests answered directly ("What is Eden?", "How does it work?"). Flow: Query → Informational detection → Direct LLM response → No workflow.

A **unified chat interface** automatically routes queries to the appropriate handler.

## Intelligence Gas (iGas)

Eden replaces blockchain gas with **Intelligence Gas (iGas)**, calculated from LLM calls, providers queried, and query complexity. iGas prices intelligence, routing, and reasoning—not compute or storage.

---

## Rule-Based Governance System (v1.24)

Eden v1.24 introduces **deterministic rule-based governance** with:

- **RAG in the Front**: Governance rules retrieved and displayed before actions (visible governance)
- **Deterministic Rule Engine**: All decisions are rule-based, not LLM-generated (no LLM authority creep)
- **Symbolic Roles**: Roles (God/ROOT CA, Priests/Gardens, Garden Owners) are permissions, not god-mode
- **Time-Decay Trust**: Trust and permissions decay over time, requiring renewal
- **QR-Code Device Binding**: Default authentication via QR-code device binding (v1.24)

## Key Differentiators

1. **Garden-First Architecture**: Gardens primary, blockchain subordinate
2. **Intelligence as Currency**: iGas prices intelligence, not compute
3. **Governed Messaging**: First-class primitive with governed conversations
4. **Dual-Mode Chat**: Unified interface for workflows and information
5. **Rule-Based Governance**: Deterministic rules with RAG retrieval (v1.24)
6. **Centralized Service Registry**: Single source of truth for all services
7. **Settlement Authority**: Only ROOT CA can settle, preventing double-spending

---

## Governance Model

- **Priest = Garden**: Gardens certify and govern
- **GOD = ROOT CA**: Ultimate authority (law, not power)
- **Judgment Day = Ledger Settlement**: Final, immutable judgment

Safer than Web3: trust is certified (not mined), settlement is centralized (preventing double-spending), intelligence is priced fairly.

---

## Conclusion

Eden shifts from blockchain-first to garden-first architecture, where intelligence is currency, messaging is governed, and trust is certified. The dual-mode chat interface provides seamless support for both transactional and informational interactions. Eden scales down instead of up, enabling human-understandable, LLM-governed, self-policing trust systems—without censorship, erasure, or centralized control.
